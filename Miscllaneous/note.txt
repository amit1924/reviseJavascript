When user.name and user[name] Are Different:

Dynamic Property Access:
Dot notation (user.name) always accesses the property literally named "name".

Bracket notation (user[name]) accesses the property named according to the value of the name variable.

Example:


const user = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
};

const name = "firstName";

console.log(user.name);   // Output: undefined (because there's no "name" property)

console.log(user[name]);  // Output: John (because name is "firstName")

Here, user.name and user[name] are different because name is a variable, and user[name] is accessing user.firstName.

Dot Notation (user.name):

Accesses the property literally named "name".
Simpler and often used when you know the exact property name.


Bracket Notation (user[name]):

Accesses a property using the value of the name variable, allowing dynamic property access.
More flexible and necessary when the property name is not known until runtime.
In summary, while user.name and user["name"] are the same when accessing a literal property called "name", user[name] is different when name is a variable containing a property name.
